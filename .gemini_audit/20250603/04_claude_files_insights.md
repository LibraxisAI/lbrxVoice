# Audit Report: Insights from `.claude/*.md` Files

**Date of Audit:** 2025-06-03
**Auditor:** Gemini AI Assistant

## Status of File Analysis

As per the user's request, an attempt was made to locate and read files matching the pattern `.claude/claude*.md` or, by inference from the `tree` output, `CLAUDE.local.md` and `CLAUDE.md` located in the project root.

**Unfortunately, these files could not be accessed or read by the automated tooling at the time of the audit.**

```
Tool execution logs for reading CLAUDE.local.md:
Error calling tool: Could not find file 'CLAUDE.local.md' in the workspace.

Tool execution logs for reading CLAUDE.md:
Error calling tool: Could not find file 'CLAUDE.md' in the workspace.
```

## Implications

Without access to these files, any specific information they might contain regarding:

*   **Dates:** Specific timelines or project milestones noted by "Klaudiusz."
*   **"MCP Memory" / "Project Memory":** Context or details pertaining to these terms, presumably internal project jargon or metrics.
*   Other annotations, observations, or plans from "Klaudiusz."

could not be incorporated into this audit report.

## Recommendation

If the information within `CLAUDE.local.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (or similarly named files in a `.claude/` directory if it exists elsewhere) is deemed critical for a more comprehensive understanding of the project's history, internal assessments, or specific developer notes, it is recommended to:

1.  **Verify File Paths and Accessibility:** Ensure the files are present at the specified paths and have correct read permissions.
2.  **Manually Extract and Provide Information:** If automated access remains an issue, relevant excerpts or summaries from these files should be manually provided for consideration in future analyses or project planning.

This audit proceeds based on the `pro/INTERNAL_ANALYSIS.mdx` document and the project's file structure, which have provided substantial material for assessment.
