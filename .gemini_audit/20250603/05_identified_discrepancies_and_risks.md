# Audit Report: Identified Discrepancies and Risks

**Date of Audit:** 2025-06-03
**Auditor:** Gemini AI Assistant

This section highlights discrepancies between the project's apparent goals and its current state (as "lbrxWhisper"), and the risks associated with not addressing them. These points are largely based on the self-critique found in `pro/INTERNAL_ANALYSIS.mdx`.

## 1. Discrepancy: Stated Goal vs. Actual State ("lbrxWhisper" phase)

*   **Goal:** A production-ready, efficient, and focused multivoice STT/TTS system ("lbrxVoicePro").
*   **Current State ("lbrxWhisper"):**
    *   Described as a "chaos dev playground."
    *   Significant number of non-working or problematic components (DIA TTS, CSM servers).
    *   High complexity: 400+ files, 15,000+ lines of code, 50+ dependencies, long startup times, high memory usage.
    *   Only an estimated 40% of features were considered "working" before the "lbrxVoicePro" initiative.
    *   Scattered and disorganized structure.
    *   Overengineering in certain areas (TUI, multiple pipelines, excessive API protocols for few users).

**This is the primary discrepancy:** The project's ambition was not matched by its execution and organization in the "lbrxWhisper" phase. The `INTERNAL_ANALYSIS.mdx` is a clear acknowledgment of this.

## 2. Identified Risks (Mitigated by adopting "lbrxVoicePro" plan)

The risks listed below are primarily associated with the *previous* "lbrxWhisper" state. The `INTERNAL_ANALYSIS.mdx` and the plan to transition to "lbrxVoicePro" are direct mitigations for these risks.

*   **Risk of Project Failure/Stagnation:**
    *   The high number of non-working components and the "40% working features" statistic indicate a system struggling to deliver on its core promises.
    *   Without a focused cleanup and restructuring, the project could become unmanageable and fail to achieve its objectives.
*   **Poor Investor/Stakeholder Perception:**
    *   The "lbrxWhisper" state ("chaos dev playground", "warsztat mechanika") is unsuitable for showcasing to potential investors like "Sesame AI Labs."
    *   Presenting a system with many non-functional parts, high complexity, and unclear focus would undermine confidence. The internal document explicitly states what *not* to show: "Mamy 10 różnych TTS (bo 8 nie działa)".
*   **Inability to Scale or Evolve:**
    *   The chaotic structure and high technical debt would make it extremely difficult to add new features, integrate new models, or scale the system reliably.
*   **High Maintenance Costs & Development Inefficiency:**
    *   Navigating a complex and disorganized codebase increases development time for bug fixes and new features.
    *   Onboarding new developers would be slow and challenging.
    *   The "15,000+ lines of code" vs. "1,771" for lbrxVoicePro suggests significant bloat and dead code.
*   **Wasted Resources:**
    *   Time and effort spent on developing and maintaining components that don't work or are overly engineered.
    *   Excessive memory usage (8GB vs 2GB) and long startup times (45s vs 3s) point to inefficient resource utilization.
*   **Loss of Credibility/Focus:**
    *   The "Pokażmy że umiemy wszystko!" (Let's show we can do everything!) approach, leading to many half-finished or non-working features, can damage the project's credibility.
    *   The internal document's shift to "Pokażmy że to faktycznie działa" (Let's show it actually works) is a direct counter to this.
*   **Risk of "Not Invented Here" Syndrome or Over-Complication:**
    *   Developing multiple pipelines or planning for multiple API types for a small user base could be signs of over-complicating solutions where simpler, existing ones might suffice.

## 3. Conclusion

The `INTERNAL_ANALYSIS.mdx` document demonstrates a strong awareness of these discrepancies and risks. The proposed "lbrxVoicePro" architecture and philosophy are well-aligned to mitigate these issues. The critical factor for success is the diligent execution of the refactoring plan.
